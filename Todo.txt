Additions to memory-game


clean up and organise colorGame-functions.js code
really need to improve my scoping of variables. If I could do this it would massively simplify the code.
how to use call/bind/apply on a function?? Can I reduce the if conditionals down to a function call?


CSS
----------------------------
- change winning message
- Make transitions take time, not instantaneous
- Improve overall layout / styling of webpage.
----------------------------

JS
----------------------------
- change turn counter css id when counter >= 10. Is there a classList.add analogue for id's?
- make the game 1 or 2 player.
- Fix probability.js script to correctly calculate the probabilities for colorGenerator();
- Integrate probability.js into the colorGame script.
  This is to ensure settings not changed to enable infinite loop.
----------------------------


Advanced
----------------------------
- Store data for turns taken to finish game for all board sizes / difficulties.
- Display specific chart for each board size / difficulty.
- Add users data to chart once finished game and report back what percentile they finished in.
- Calculate and display chart for number of turns in a perfect game.
  (statistically this will be a distribution).
